# Solutions for "How to Design Programs"

This repository contains solutions to roughly 200 exercises from the book
[How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/). They were done during the summer of 2014.
There might be a few incomplete solutions but most of them should be complete.
I provide no guarantees of correctness but the tests should be passing for the completed exercises.

The second edition of the book was incomplete at the time I was doing the exercises.
The solutions in the `htdp1` folder are from the first edition of the book.

## Video lectures

I found these [video lectures](https://vimeo.com/album/1987192) useful when I was reading the book.
